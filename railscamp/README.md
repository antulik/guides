# Rails Camp

## Updates and Contributions

This document is open source. You're welcome to open issues with any questions you might have, and if you've organised Rails Camps (or other events) before, please do submit pull requests with any details you feel should be covered but aren't.

## So you want to run a Rails Camp!

This guide is meant to give a potential organiser a reasonably detailed list of things that must be considered when planning and running a Rails Camp.

It is super important that an organiser does not rely on *only* this document. Talk to previous organisers and seek the help of Ruby Australia for advice and support when you need it.

## Becoming an organiser

There is no official organiser selection process as such, but often the organiser(s) for the next Rails Camp volunteer at a Ruby Australia AGM at the current Rails Camp. First preference is usually given to the states and territories that haven't hosted before (or have had the longest break since last hosting), but only if there are volunteers for that state/territory.

For example, during the Ruby Australia AGM at Rails Camp Perth in November 2014, Leonard Garvey volunteered to run the Rails Camp Sydney event that eventually took place in June 2015.

Do not be a solo organiser! The majority of Rails Camps are organized by two or three core volunteers. Do not underestimate the amount of work it takes, especially closer to the date of the event.


## Typical timeline

### 6+ months before the event

#### Find a venue

Get a written quote. It should state the following:

  - the deposit amount
  - whether not GST is inclusive/exclusive
  - the minimum number of attendees (if there is a minimum for the venue)
  - the maximum number of attendees
  - whether catering is included or additional

One you have a quote, send the quote the Ruby Australia Treasurer and run it by them.  If it is all reasonable then ask the venue for an invoice, send it through to the treasure and it will get paid. Once that happens, it's all official.

## Budgeting

Camp budget templates can be supplied by previous organisers, which will provide a good starting point.

Income will likely come from two sources:

* Tickets
* Sponsorship

Expenses will include some/most of the following:

* Venue
* Food
* Buses

All of these items are discussed below in more detail.

## Tickets

Ruby Australia has existing accounts for the payment gateway Pin Payments, and the ticketing service Tito, so it is perhaps easiest to leverage these. No matter who you go with, though, you will need to factor in fees for both into your budget.

You will also need to charge GST for your tickets - due to the size of Ruby Australia's yearly income, it is required to collect GST. Again, factor this into your budget accordingly.

You will likely want to offer the following tickets:

* Full
* Concession
* Scholarship/Diversity

If camping in tents is an option at the venue, and results in a lower venue cost for those attendees, you may wish to offer camping tickets at a slightly discounted rate as well.

Early-bird tickets are another option, though may be unneccesary.

If your venue is smaller than usual (holding fewer than 100 people) and a high demand is expected, there is also the option of running a ticket ballot: people can enter the ballot before a well-publicised deadline, and then tickets are randomly allocated. Previous camp organisers may have code you can re-use for this purpose.

When running a ballot, Ruby Australia committee should be given reserved places (if they wish to attend) for the purpose of the General Meeting that will take place.

## Sponsorship

Ruby Australia provides financial sponsorship through their yearly sponsorship packages used to support all events over the course of a year. The committee will be able to give you a dollar value for this, and provide the details of associated sponsors and their logos, and any particular initiatives their funds should go towards.

Alongside that, you're welcome (and indeed, encouraged) to ask organisations for further support to help offset the ticket costs. It can be useful to have these additional sponsors pay for specific camp expenses, such as:

- transport (coaches / trains / minibuses to and from the airport)
- diversity tickets
- soft drinks and alcoholic drinks
- coffee, tea, coffee machines and/or barista

You could also consider:

- special meals like bbqs or brisket?
- a fancier selection of drinks
- hipster food trucks
- some other amazing thing?

If you are confident you can get significant sponsorship you could consider subsidising the ticket price.

## Catering

Often the camp itself will provide food, but the catering is often targeted towards school children who are active all day instead of a group of sedentary adults. Here's a rough guideline:

- less carbs
- more fresh veg
- simple whole foods

Ask the venue if you can bring in an external caterer.
Ask the venue if you can approve/adjust the menu several months before the camp.
Make sure to emphasise to the camp and the caterers that this isn't a group of school kids. Pasta should not be in every meal, eggs must be cooked fresh etc.
Have fresh fruit available at all times during the camp.

## FAQ

- Am I personally exposed to financial risk if I make a mistake with budgeting?

  No. Ruby Australia has your back, but it is definitely worth maintaining a budget spreadsheet that can be shared with the Ruby Australia treasurer to mitigate the risk of financial errors occurring.

- Will I need to cover any costs myself?

  All costs should ideally be covered by ticket sales and sponsorship. However, it's likely that some extra unforeseen costs will come up during the camp itself, or for things that are planned but must be purchased personally before being reimbursed by Ruby Australia.

  For example, an additional $1500 AUD was spent by the organisers of Rails Camp Sydney during the event to cover the cost of additional alcohol, and more for transport and catering supplies, the cost of which was reimbursed by Ruby Australia a couple of days after the event.

- Does Ruby Australia have insurance that covers the event? Is additional insurance required?

- Do I *have to* charge GST?

  Yes. Your ticket prices must include GST. 10% of the ticket price is not yours to spend. Budget for this.

- Where can I get hold of the @railscamp_au Twitter account details?

  Contact the previous Rails Camp organisers. Ruby AU is working on a better thing for this.
