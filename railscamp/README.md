# Rails Camp

## So you want to run a Rails Camp!

This guide is meant to give a potential organiser a reasonably detailed list of things that must be considered when planning and running a Rails Camp.

It is super important that an organiser does not rely on *only* this document. Talk to previous organisers and seek the help of Ruby Australia for advice and support when you need it.

## Keeping this document up to date

This document is open source. Organisers new and old are encouraged to submit enhancements.

## Becoming an organiser

There is no official organiser selection process as such, but often the organiser(s) for the next Rails Camp volunteer at a Ruby Australia AGM at the current Rails Camp. First preference is usually given to the states and territories that haven't hosted before (or have had the longest break since last hosting), but only if there are volunteers for that state/territory.

For example, during the Ruby Australia AGM at Rails Camp Perth in November 2014, Leonard Garvey volunteered to run the Rails Camp Sydney event that eventually took place in June 2015.

Do not be a solo organiser! The majority of Rails Camps are organized by two or three core volunteers. Do not underestimate the amount of work it takes, especially closer to the date of the event.


## Typical timeline

### 6+ months before the event

#### Find a venue

Get a written quote. It should state the following:

  - the deposit amount
  - whether not GST is inclusive/exclusive
  - the minimum number of attendees (if there is a minimum for the venue)
  - the maximum number of attendees
  - whether catering is included or additional

One you have a quote, send the quote the Ruby Australia Treasurer and run it by them.  If it is all reasonable then ask the venue for an invoice, send it through to the treasure and it will get paid. Once that happens, it's all official.

## Budgeting

The most important choice you will make for budgeting is figuring out your ticket pricing. Take the amount per head provided by the camp and add ~$50.

Another good portion of your budget will come from sponsorship. But because you won't know how much sponsorship you can get when you're starting to plan, the best idea is to have stretch goals. This is discussed further in the sponsorship section.

## Tickets

  - Choose a ticketing provider. Previous choices have been Pin Payments and ti.to (which others?)
  - Ruby Australia has a Pin Payments account and a ti.to account. Either of which you can use to charge money.
  - Factor in the ticketing provider's fee into your budget.
  - Do not forget to account for GST in costs
  - GST must be charged. Ruby Australia is a non-profit, but it still must pay sales tax.

## Sponsorship

You want to target your sponsorship towards funding "extras" such as:

- transport (coaches / trains / minibuses to and from the airport)
- diversity tickets
- soft drinks and alcoholic drinks
- coffee, tea, coffee machines and/or barista

You could also consider:

- special meals like bbqs or brisket?
- a fancier selection of drinks
- hipster food trucks
- some other amazing thing?

If you are confident you can get significant sponsorship you could consider subsidising the ticket price.

## Catering

Often the camp itself will provide food, but the catering is often targeted towards school children who are active all day instead of a group of sedentary adults. Here's a rough guideline:

- less carbs
- more fresh veg
- simple whole foods

Ask the venue if you can bring in an external caterer.
Ask the venue if you can approve/adjust the menu several months before the camp.
Make sure to emphasise to the camp and the caterers that this isn't a group of school kids. Pasta should not be in every meal, eggs must be cooked fresh etc.
Have fresh fruit available at all times during the camp.

## Drinks

## Transport

## Optional camp activities

## Network

## Volunteers for extra help during the event

## FAQ

- Am I personally exposed to financial risk if I make a mistake with budgeting?

  No. Ruby Australia has your back, but it is definitely worth maintaining a budget spreadsheet that can be shared with the Ruby Australia treasurer to mitigate the risk of financial errors occurring.

- Will I need to cover any costs myself?

  All costs should ideally be covered by ticket sales and sponsorship. However, it's likely that some extra unforeseen costs will come up during the camp itself, or for things that are planned but must be purchased personally before being reimbursed by Ruby Australia.

  For example, an additional $1500 AUD was spent by the organisers of Rails Camp Sydney during the event to cover the cost of additional alcohol, and more for transport and catering supplies, the cost of which was reimbursed by Ruby Australia a couple of days after the event.

- Does Ruby Australia have insurance that covers the event? Is additional insurance required?

- Do I *have to* charge GST?

  Yes. Your ticket prices must include GST. 10% of the ticket price is not yours to spend. Budget for this.

- Where can I get hold of the @railscamp_au Twitter account details?

  Contact the previous Rails Camp organisers. Ruby AU is working on a better thing for this.
