# Rails Camp

## Updates and Contributions

This document is open source. You're welcome to open issues with any questions you might have, and if you've organised Rails Camps (or other events) before, please do submit pull requests with any details you feel should be covered but aren't.

The Ruby Australia committee can be contacted by emailing [committee@ruby.org.au](mailto:committee@ruby.org.au).

## So you want to run a Rails Camp!

This guide is meant to give a potential organiser a reasonably detailed list of things that must be considered when planning and running a Rails Camp.

It is super important that an organiser does not rely on *only* this document. Talk to previous organisers and seek the help of Ruby Australia for advice and support when you need it.

## Becoming an organiser

There is no official organiser selection process as such, but often the organiser(s) for the next Rails Camp volunteer at a Ruby Australia AGM at the current Rails Camp. For example, during the Ruby Australia AGM at Rails Camp Perth in November 2014, Leonard Garvey volunteered to run the Rails Camp Sydney event that eventually took place in June 2015.

First preference is usually given to the states and territories that haven't hosted before (or have had the longest break since last hosting), but only if there are volunteers for that state/territory.

Anyone who is interested in volunteering should get in touch with the Ruby Australia committee to see what plans are in place for future camps and get your offer on their radar. If you have some fellow volunteers to work with, that's even better. A core team of two or three people is highly recommended - running a Rails Camp is a lot of work!

## Now that you're an organiser, what's next?

Your first steps should be:

* Rope in some fellow volunteers to help organise
* Find potential venues in your chosen area and timeframe
* Put together a budget

Please keep in mind that previous organisers and the Ruby Australia committee will all be happy to provide feedback along the way.

## Venue Considerations

### Types of Venues

Rails Camps are generally run at venues that cater for large groups with dormitory rooms. Often, their usual clients are school groups or scouts. They're usually pretty lo-fi - shared bathrooms, basic bedding, etc. The advantages are that these venues can sometimes hold 150+ people, and usually are not particularly expensive.

Researching for venues can sometimes be tricky - but searching for school and scout campsites is a good place to start. It's _highly recommended_ that you visit the venue if at all possible to confirm it's going to be fit for purpose.

### Scheduling

Rails Camps in Australia run from Friday afternoon through to Monday morning, and occur in the middle of the year (June or July), or towards the end of the year (usually November, sometimes December). So, that should give you a decent timeframe for enquiring about available weekends.

It's worth keeping in mind the weather. While we've not been perfect at this, there's a rough goal of having southern camps in November, and northern camps in June/July, which generally leads to the more pleasant conditions.

You'll also want to check about related events that may potentially conflict, including:

* [RubyConf AU](http://rubyconf.org.au)
* [Rails Camp New Zealand](http://camp.ruby.nz)
* [CampJS](http://campjs.com)
* [ElixirCamp](http://elixir.camp)
* [Web Directions](http://www.webdirections.org)

If at all possible, steer clear of running a Rails Camp in direct competition with these events - and ideally have a few weeks, if not a month, gap between any of the camp events.

### Location

Camp locations have historically been within an hour or so from the nearest city and/or airport - ideally, somewhere easily accessible by cars and buses. Sometimes other modes of transport have been required (e.g. ferries) - which can add to the sense of adventure, but also adds extra organising overhead for you.

### Accessibility

Most venues will likely cater for a variety of accessibility needs (i.e.: for those in wheelchairs, or using crutches, etc). It doesn't hurt to confirm with potential venues just to be sure.

### Capacity

These days, Rails Camps in Australia usually host 100+ people - sometimes they're closer to 150, sometimes they're closer to 80. Having a venue that can fit a larger group is preferred, but make sure you're clear with the venue on whether the hiring fee will be per-person or a flat rate, and if it's the former what the timeframes for final confirmation are.

### Camping

Some people like to camp in actual tents at Rails Camp. These people usually number somewhere between a handful and a dozen - the clear majority of attendees prefer a dorm bed over a tent. It's worth confirming with the venue whether camping is allowed - it's certainly not a deal breaker, but it's good to be clear.

### Facilities

It's great to have several spaces available for the event:

* A dining room that everyone can fit in.
* A coding room that (almost) everyone can fit in. Sometimes, this is the dining room.
* At least one sessions room for presentations.
* A room for Werewolf and other games. Sometimes, this is the sessions room, but it's good to have more than one if at all possible.
* A quiet room, for those who would like to code or read or do other things where they're far less likely to be disturbed, and there's no expectation to be social.

You will need a projector for each session room, and probably for the dining or coding room as well (for introductory comments and Sunday night show-and-tell). If the venue doesn't have them, you can try asking local Ruby companies to borrow theirs.

### Alcohol

Some campsites - especially those aimed at children, or those run by religious associations - have an alcohol-free policy. If you want to run a dry camp (which has not yet been tried, but this is your prerogative), then this won't be an issue, but otherwise, you'll need to keep going with your search for appropriate venues.

### Electricity

100+ developers means 100+ devices drawing power. Most campsites handle this without any issues, but if they're using generators rather than connected to the grid, this may be a sticking point. Something to confirm with any likely venues!

### First Aid

Most venues will have first aid supplies, but it's worth confirming. You should also check if they'll have any staff members on-site who are certified to provide first aid. Otherwise, you'll need to find some attendees who can volunteer in this capacity.

### Insurance

Most venues will require event insurance. Ruby Australia has an insurance policy for this very purpose which you should use.

### Emergency Plans

Make sure you're across the emergency evacuation procedure for the venue, and that you or a member of the venue staff explains that on the Friday evening opening remarks.

It's also handy to have one of your organising team with a car in case anyone needs to urgently get back to civilisation (for example: in the case of injury).

### Getting a Quote

If you're seriously considering a venue, get a written quote from them. It should state the following:

  - the deposit amount
  - whether not GST is inclusive/exclusive
  - the minimum number of attendees (if there is a minimum for the venue)
  - the maximum number of attendees
  - whether catering is included or additional

Once you have quotes from all your potential venues, decide on which is going to be the best fit. Then, discuss this venue with the Ruby Australia treasurer and anyone else you'd like feedback from.

If it is all reasonable then ask the venue for an invoice, send that invoice through to the treasurer and it will get paid. Congratulations, you now have a confirmed venue! This might be the time to announce the dates so potential attendees can plan accordingly.

## Planning

### Timeline

This is a rough guide - if you fall behind it's not the end of the world, but certainly good to be on top of things sooner rather than later!

* 6 months out: confirm a venue
* 4 months out: release tickets
* 1 month out: close registrations
* 2 weeks out: confirm numbers with the venue and caterers
* Monday evening after the camp: collapse into bed after a job well done.

The deadlines to confirm numbers with the venue and the caterers are worth confirming - it's good to know the very latest numbers can be updated, in case of late registrations.

### Budget

Camp budget templates can be supplied by previous organisers, which will provide a good starting point.

Income will likely come from two sources:

* Tickets
* Sponsorship

Expenses will include some/most of the following:

* Venue
* Catering
* Transport

All of these items are discussed in their respective sections of this guide.

Get some numbers into a spreadsheet (perhaps copied off a previous camp's budget), and spend some time understanding the amount of funds required for such an event, and especially what the minimum numbers are to break even.

Having conversations with the Ruby Australia treasurer regularly is recommended, to ensure things are tracking along at a healthy level. If it turns out that despite best intentions (and all the plans you've made and followed) you do make a small loss, this is not the end of the world. Ruby Australia does allow for these situations and can cover the shortfall. That said, do your very best to make a small profit.

### Invoices

You will also have the assistance of the Ruby Australia treasurer for issuing and paying any invoices required for the event.

### Attendees

Numbers vary for camps for a variety of reasons - the location, the dates, people's interests changing, etc. It's not unexpected for a camp to have 100+ attendees, but excellent camps have been run with 50 attendees. It's recommended you opt for a modest number as part of your planning for breaking even (and previous organisers can help suggest what that might be).

## Tickets

Ruby Australia has existing accounts for the payment gateway Pin Payments, and the ticketing service Tito, so it is perhaps easiest to leverage these. No matter who you go with, though, you will need to factor in fees for both into your budget.

You will also need to charge GST for your tickets - due to the size of Ruby Australia's yearly income, it is required to collect GST. Again, factor this into your budget accordingly.

You will likely want to offer the following tickets:

* Full
* Concession
* Scholarship/Diversity

If camping in tents is an option at the venue, and results in a lower venue cost for those attendees, you may wish to offer camping tickets at a slightly discounted rate as well.

Early-bird tickets are another option, though may be unnecessary.

### Ballots

If your venue is smaller than usual (holding fewer than 100 people) and a high demand is expected, there is also the option of running a ticket ballot: people can enter the ballot before a well-publicised deadline, and then tickets are randomly allocated. Previous camp organisers may have code you can re-use for this purpose.

When running a ballot, Ruby Australia committee should be given reserved places (if they wish to attend) for the purpose of the General Meeting that will take place.

### Deadlines

### Scholarship / Diversity Tickets

## Communication

If you've got a venue and dates confirmed, then it's time to start spreading the word. You'll likely want a website for the camp itself, plus an updated listing on [railscamps.com](http://railscamps.com), and then you can start spreading the word through mailing lists, Twitter, meets, etc.

### Website

Once you've got the dates locked down for the venue, it's time to get a basic website up. Initially it should outline the date, location, and the Code of Conduct (which is Ruby Australia's).

When it's time to release tickets, you'll want those on the website, and it's also recommended to have transport plans listed sooner rather than later, so people can book their flights to match the bus times.

Using an existing Rails Camp site is likely an excellent place to start! You can go all out if you really want, but at the end of the day people aren't going to care much if it's not shiny.
 
### Promotion

These are just some suggestions on where to promote the Rails Camp:

* [Australian](http://ruby.org.au) and [New Zealand](http://ruby.nz) Ruby meets
* [Ruby or Rails Oceania](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-oceania) and [Rails Camp](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railscamp) Google groups
* [Ruby Australia Slack](https://rubyau-slack.herokuapp.com)
* Twitter ([@railscamp_au](https://twitter.com/railscamp_au), [@rubyaustralia](https://twitter.com/rubyaustralia))
* Rails Girls
* Universities (especially to promote the concession tickets)

## Sponsorship

Ruby Australia provides financial sponsorship through their yearly sponsorship packages used to support all events over the course of a year. The committee will be able to give you a dollar value for this, and provide the details of associated sponsors and their logos, and any particular initiatives their funds should go towards.

Alongside that, you're welcome (and indeed, encouraged) to ask organisations for further support to help offset the ticket costs. It can be useful to have these additional sponsors pay for specific camp expenses, such as:

- transport (coaches / trains / minibuses to and from the airport)
- diversity tickets
- soft drinks and alcoholic drinks
- coffee, tea, coffee machines and/or barista

You could also consider:

- special meals like bbqs or brisket?
- a fancier selection of drinks
- hipster food trucks
- some other amazing thing?

If you are confident you can get significant sponsorship you could consider subsidising the ticket price.

## Catering

Early Rails Camps had group efforts providing food for everyone, but as the events grew, these efforts did not scale - especially when it's the attendees who were doing the food preparation. So, caterers are engaged for camps to cover the food required for the event.

Unless you're making special plans for a meal or two, this will include dinner on Friday, breakfast, lunch and dinner for Saturday and Sunday, and breakfast on Monday (8 meals in total). Some camps have also supplied morning and/or afternoon tea, which is appreciated as well.

### Caterers

Often venues will insist on using their own catering service - though if you're allowed to bring in your own caterers, it's worth getting a few quotes to ensure you're getting a good deal for good food.

Ideally, you want to be working with the caterers to approve/adjust their suggested menus. It's best to make this clear with whoever you engage to be caterers.

### Meals

School camp caterers are used to preparing meals for children who are active all day, which is different to a group of mostly sedentary adults. So, you should make it clear to the caterers that you will require a menu that has lots of fresh vegetables and is not carbohydrate-heavy.

An approach that has worked in the past is having each component of meals separate, so people can choose just the options that suit them (which makes life easier for people with allergies, intolerances, and strong preferences).

### Snacks

Having food available between meals is important - sometimes people miss meals, or need some extra things to snack upon to keep them going. Fresh fruit is a great option for this (healthy and cheap).

It can also be helpful to have a late-night supper available to help soak up the alcohol that people are drinking. Party pies, pizza slices and other savoury snacks have been welcome dishes for this at previous camps.

### Beverages

The usual approach for drinks is to provide a variety of beers, ciders, teas, juices and soft drinks for attendees. Certainly, having many options of each of these is recommended, but it's best to encourage attendees to bring their own hard liquor if they're so inclined.

A dry (alcohol-free) camp has not yet been run. That doesn't mean it shouldn't, but if you make this decision, you should make it _very_ clear on the website and other event notices. Discussing this with past organisers is wise.

Or, you could let everyone bring their own alcohol, and not supply any. Again, this would be something to make extra clear in communications, and it'd be wise to add a battleship stop for the bus journey to the venue.

Some camps in the past have used kegs for beer and cider. This has proved to be problematic: you become reliant on equipment you and other attendees might not be familiar with, those who do get trained on the equipment must always be present (and reasonably sober), and it might be harder to offload any unused kegs.

Approaches to coffee have varied. The extremely hardcore will bring their own gear, but usually at least an espresso machine is provided. Sometimes a barista is hired to be on-site for Saturday and Sunday (within given hours, or staying on-site if they're particularly keen).

### Food Delivery

If you're planning on bringing a lot of food and/or drink to the event (e.g. snacks and drinks), it's worthwhile checking whether supermarket delivery services (Coles, Woolworths, etc) cover the area. This can potentially save you a lot of transport hassle (though you'll need to manage leftover supplies yourself).

## Transport

### To the campsite and back

### Flights to the appropriate airport

### During the camp

You or other organisers should have a car or two available during the event for any emergencies, or to go get extra supplies should you run out of something.

There's a decent chance some attendees will drive as well, and they are often happy to help out with lifts and errands.

## FAQ

- Am I personally exposed to financial risk if I make a mistake with budgeting?

  No. Ruby Australia has your back, but it is definitely worth maintaining a budget spreadsheet that can be shared with the Ruby Australia treasurer to mitigate the risk of financial errors occurring.

- Will I need to cover any costs myself?

  All costs should ideally be covered by ticket sales and sponsorship. However, it's likely that some extra unforeseen costs will come up during the camp itself, or for things that are planned but must be purchased personally before being reimbursed by Ruby Australia.

  For example, an additional $1500 AUD was spent by the organisers of Rails Camp Sydney during the event to cover the cost of additional alcohol, and more for transport and catering supplies, the cost of which was reimbursed by Ruby Australia a couple of days after the event.

- Does Ruby Australia have insurance that covers the event? Is additional insurance required?

- Do I *have to* charge GST?

  Yes. Your ticket prices must include GST. 10% of the ticket price is not yours to spend. Budget for this.

- Where can I get hold of the @railscamp_au Twitter account details?

  Contact the previous Rails Camp organisers. Ruby AU is working on a better thing for this.
