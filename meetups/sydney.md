Sydney Roro meetup
==================

Current organisers: Joss Paling, Tracy Mu Sung, Andrew Harvey

## Schedule
- Arrive and mingle with dinner from 6 to 6:30
- Welcome: the host of the meetup welcomes everyone and thanks the sponsors
- The host asks brand new people to raise their hands, then we have a few minutes where regulars sitting/standing around those new people introduce themselves and welcome them
- Talks commence, with 5 minute break between each
- After talks, the host invites people to share tips and tricks with the group
- The host goes through events that are upcoming
- People offering work are given the opportunity to give a quick pitch (30 seconds each)
- Wrap up before 8:30, people move on to non-official venues to carry on socialising

## Talks

Talks are submitted at our [issues page](https://github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues) and are selected, scheduled and confirmed by the meetup organisers.

Each meetup has around 3 speakers - with talk length of 15 minutes each. We also will include lightning talks of 5 minutes each if available.

## Current venue

* Pivotal Labs - Level 11, 155 Clarence St, Sydney

## Date and Times

The second Tuesday of every month. Open at 6pm for 6:30pm start. Preferably leaving the venue by 8:30. Splinter groups then go to nearby pub, or the recent non-pub option of ice cream parlour.

## Food Options

We've been solely using The Char Rotisserie for the past six months.  We order the delivery through Caitre'd. It ends up being around $8 per person.
The food is in big catering trays - usually things like stroganoff and rice, stir fry's, pasta salads.
We trialled getting a bigger proportion of vegetarian dishes, but they did not go well. Stroganoff and Goulash type things are a big hit. We've been trying to avoid the ubiquitous pizza, and feedback about this catering has been good. 
The order gets placed around a week ahead of schedule, but easy to change if the meetup attendee numbers don't match

## Drinks Options

Alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks are supplied by Pivotal Labs. 

## Sponsors
* Pivotal Labs
* Ruby Australia (we promote the Ruby Australia sponsors at our events)
