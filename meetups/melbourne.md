## Talks

Talks are submitted at https://github.com/rails-oceania/melbourne-ruby/issues and selected by the meetup organizers.

Usually every meetup has 2-3 speakers. Talk length is 30min for 3 speakers and 40min for 2.

At the last meetup in 2016 (november) organisers tried new format of only lightning talks. Everybody at the meetup should be prepared to talk if selected. First host selects one random person to present from the audience. After the presentation is finished, the last presenter picks the next person and so on. Every talk has hard limit of 5 minutes but shorter is fine. No slides required. That worked very well, and there is a plan to try that format again mid year.
