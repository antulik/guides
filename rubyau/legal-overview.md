## Speedy Legal Overview

* Ruby Australia Incorporated in a non-profit association registered in the state of Victoria, Australia
* As an incorporated association your liability is limited unlike if this was just a group of mates hanging out playing Kinect Star Wars on the XBox at Pat’s place.
* That being said you are now legally responsible for the organisation. If you don’t feel you have expertise in something it’s the responsibility of committee members to seek advice and expertise if needed.
* Core membership is the attendees of Rails Camps, this is the primary group to which the committee is accountable.


## Committee Composition

According to the Ruby Australia constitution, we need to have the following office bearers: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and two general committee members.

* We have a policy that each committee member serves for no more than a year at a time, but you’re welcome to come back again.
* Ideally, three members of the committee will stand down at each general meeting whilst three will continue, thus enabling both continuity and renewal.
* We expect the lead organisers of both the previous and next Rails Camps to be on the committee.
* We expect a member of the core RubyConf AU organising group be on the committee
* We expect one member of the committee to be responsible for the ruby.org.au website

## Legals

*TODO: Check & update with the current details*

The organisation has a Public Officer, who must reside in Victoria. After RailsCamp when the Public Officer changes the government needs to be notified within 21 days (I think).
Currently Public Officer: Pat Allan
(correct at June 2012)
