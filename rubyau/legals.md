## Speedy Legal Overview

- Ruby Australia Incorporated in a non-profit association registered in the state of Victoria, Australia
- As an incorporated association your liability is limited unlike if this was just a group of mates hanging out playing Kinect Star Wars on the XBox at Pat’s place.
- That being said you are now legally responsible for the organisation. If you don’t feel you have expertise in something it’s the responsibility of committee members to seek advice and expertise if needed.
- Core membership is the attendees of Rails Camps, this is the primary group to which the committee is accountable.
