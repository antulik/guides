## Welcome to Ruby Australia

Congratulations on being elected into the Ruby Australia Committee. You will be inducted with our secret handshake and given your ruby coloured robes shortly. But first you must read this guide carefully. This guide will uncover the darkest secrets of our sect, things which others have never even hoped to want to learn of.

Regards,

The Ruby Australia Committees of Old

#### Some Guidelines on Philosophy

Ruby Australia is setup to be a light touch, open and transparent organisation deeply connected with the member base of attendees of Australian Rails Camps and Ruby Conferences.

###### First guideline: WE ARE NICE (MINSWAN)
MINSWAN ‘Matz is nice so we are nice'. We first treat people well and with dignity and respect.
The systems thinker Edward Deming said ‘80% of problems are system problems rather than people problems. Don’t Blame. Fix the system’.

###### Second guideline: WE ARE OPEN
Ruby Australia is designed to be an open organisation, think open-source meets open-space. In the second instance we draw on existing design patterns developed by our brethren in the global hackerspace movement. http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Design_Patterns

###### Third guideline:  WE ARE LEAN
Don’t over engineer solutions. Start by asking ‘what’s the simplest thing that could work’. Iterate.
Encourage everyone to focus on simple immediate solutions and being prepared to iterate and learn as an organisation as we progress.

###### Fourth guideline:  WE ACT FOR THE GREATER GOOD
It’s what gets us out of bed in the morning. Focus on what’s important. Take a long term view and approach. We’re here to make things better and strive for a higher ideal. Call people to think bigger and create something better. Don’t be right. Set about setting things right. Basically just ‘Be the Force’.

###### Fifth guideline: WE ARE HAPPY
Like ruby we exist for the furtherment of ‘programmer happiness’.

#### Transition
It’s usually really painful when you start a role and the last person didn’t really bother to hand anything over, so you just spend all this time stuffing around just working out stuff they already knew.

Don’t be that person.
Update this document and help the next poor sod who is taking over from you.
